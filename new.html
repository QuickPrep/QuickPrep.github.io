            <h1>Why Online Menu?</h1>
            <p>Most of the restaurants spend a lot of money on designing and printing the menu. Is that required in this digital era?<br><br>
                If your restaurant has 20 tables, each table needs one menu book. Suppose one menu book consists of 10 pages (say), then 200 pages should be designed and printed!! What is the cost of printing and designing? And this is not a one-time investment, the menu needs to be updated periodically and now calculate the cost invested per annum and papers used to print..?<br><br>
                Great then! Now no need to calculate these costs anymore, Online Menu allows you to create Online Menu on your own, you can easily add, delete or update your items in minutes. Customers can access your Online Menu from their phones and place their orders and can enjoy contactless dining. You just need to provide a QR code and receive orders in your dashboard. After the orders, the automated bill is generated for both owners and customers.<br><BR>
                <b>Simple:</b> Online Menu is simple to use. No download is needed, customers should scan the QR code or visit the URL and access the restaurant menu. Customers no need to wait until the waiter gets the menu book.
